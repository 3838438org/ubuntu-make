ubuntu-developer-tools-center (0.0.3) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Fix coverage reports by importing tested modules only when needed and
    when overriding "packages" and "__files__", by reloading the module
  * Some cleanups (removed unused imports)
  * Add allow-stderr for adt tests: as nose-cov print some debug output
    at start which makes adt failing then. As we control,
    stderr and warnings during tests, disable this check.
