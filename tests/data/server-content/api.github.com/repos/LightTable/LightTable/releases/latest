  "body": "## Changes\r\n- CHANGED: [:app :lt.objs.settings/pair-keymap-diffs] behavior is being deprecated. Use [:editor :lt.objs.editor/autoclose-brackets] in your user.behaviors instead. lt.objs.editor/autoclose-brackets should fix autoclosing characters e.g. '[{\" for international users.\r\n- CHANGED: Backspace key uses the same CodeMirror plugin that lt.objs.editor/autoclose-brackets does\r\n- CHANGED: lt.util.cljs/js->clj is being deprecated. Plugin authors can use the js->clj that comes with ClojureScript\r\n- CHANGED: Removed unused lt.objs.titlebar ns and lt.objs.titlebar/add-titlebar behavior\r\n- CHANGED: Removed unused styling in structure.css\r\n- CHANGED: Removed harbor and jshint node packages that belong to other LightTable plugins\r\n- CHANGED: Removed :hide-connect command which is the same as :show-connect\r\n- CHANGED: Removed light skin which was just a confusing pointer to dark skin\r\n- CHANGED: files/open-sync logs an error when trying to open a nonexistent file. Previously the error was ignored\r\n- CHANGED: Check for updates every hour instead of every 5 minutes\r\n- FIX: Git (vcs) friendly! Changing branches and doing rebases doesn't cause buggy dialogs. If a file is removed, the tab is closed. If a file has a local modification, the user decides whether to overwrite the current file or not\r\n- FIX: LightTable documentation supports navigation as it is now in a browser tab\r\n- FIX: Save and remove trailing whitespace behavior refreshes tab\r\n- FIX: Navigator no longer cuts off end of files i.e. can scroll horizontally\r\n- FIX: Case sensitive renaming of files e.g. readme -> README\r\n- FIX: Faster detection of binaries in build scripts\r\n- FIX: In linux, middle click to close tab doesn't paste clipboard contents\r\n- FIX: :open-path command resolves relative paths before opening them\r\n- FIX: Clearer description of font-settings behavior\r\n- FIX: Clear console error when github endpoints returns invalid JSON\r\n- FIX: All errors are consistently caught and logged to console\r\n- ADDED: Light Table builds without warnings on ClojureScript 1.7.x\r\n- ADDED: Add build target for generating cljsdeps.js (need for ClojureScript upgrade)\r\n- ADDED: Linux and Windows users have access keys on menus\r\n- ADDED: Linux and Windows users have additional menu items under File: Quit Light Table and About Light Table\r\n- ADDED: Added file type definitions for html templates: ERB, ASPX, EJS, JSP\r\n- ADDED: Command-0/Ctrl-0 to reset zoom and Command-=/Ctrl-= to zoom in\r\n- ADDED: Disply notification to user after installing/updating/uninstalling a plugin\r\n\r\n## Checksums\r\n\r\nThe MD5 checksums are reproducible on OSX and Linux with `openssl md5 FILE` and on Windows with `certUtil -hashfile FILE MD5`.\r\n\r\n - Windows â€“ 9cdda77518e86243a52bdb88e9ddebb8\r\n - Ubuntu (14.04) - 7e4efcce58f2f4a44edb5bde6f5a91db\r\n - OSX 10.10 - 4f9fb2dd330d589a109c582a6472a4a5 "
